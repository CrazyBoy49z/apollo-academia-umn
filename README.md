`apollo-academia` is a merged repository from various smaller repositories, containing code and assignment solutions from a variety of classes I have taken throughout my undergraduate career.

Each folder was previously an individual repository, but I have decided to combine it all into one larger repository for ease of organization.

*Most* of the code is in functional state.
