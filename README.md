`apollo-academia` is a merged repository from various smaller repositories, containing code and assignment solutions from a variety of classes I have taken throughout my undergraduate career.

Each folder was previously an individual repository, but I have decided to combine it all into one larger repository for ease of organization.

*Most* of the code is in functional state. (I usually indicate what doesn't work) Also note that I have decided to maintain the master branch with squashed merges instead of a full merge to keep history between branches separate (as each branch is unrelated, and combining all the commits made no sense). 

An index of branches (that used to be repositories) can be found below, along with links to my other standalone repositories that may contain even more code.
