I have implemented the following algorithms:

1. AC3 for Futoshiki
2. MAC for Futoshiki 
3. MRV for Cryptarithmetic
4. Forward Checking for Cryptarithmetic 

To run the programs.

For AC3 for Futoshiki
1. cd futoshiki
2. python3 	Futoshiki_AC3.py

For MAC for Futoshiki
1. cd futoshiki
2. python3 Futoshiki_MAC.py

For MRV for Cryptarithmetic
1. cd Cryptarithmetic_MRV/
2. python3 MRV_Crypt.py

For Forward Checking for Cryptarithmetic
1. cd Cryptarithmetic_ForwardChecking/
2. python3 ForwardChecking_Crypt.py

Tests are only executed for the first test case and can be changed in professor's code.

**Code for MRV is buggy. Please review before actual use.**
