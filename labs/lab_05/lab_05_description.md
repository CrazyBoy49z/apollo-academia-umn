Lab 5 - Questions and discussion on programs as data

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Fall 2014*


In this lab we will discuss your questions about homework 4.

Read over the specification of homework 4 before lab and come prepared
with questions about how to solve these problems.

If you email your questions to csci2041@cs.umn.edu before 5pm on
Monday we will include them in the initial discussions during the lab.

While attendance at most labs is required, this is not the case for
this question-and-answer style of lab.

There is nothing to turn in for this lab.
