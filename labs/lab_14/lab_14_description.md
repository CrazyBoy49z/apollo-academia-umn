# Lab 14 - Return Exam 2 and  Hwk 9 and 10 Questions

December 2, 2014

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Fall 2014*

In this lab we will hand back your second mid term exam.  You will be
able to ask the TAs about your exam and solutions will be discussed.

You can also ask questions questions about homework 9 and 10.

If you email your questions to csci2041@cs.umn.edu before lab
and we will include them in the initial discussions during the lab.

While attendance at some labs is required, this is not the case for
this question-and-answer style of lab.

There is nothing to turn in for this lab.

Even if you are in lab when working on a homework assignment the same
rules regarding not working toghether still apply.  With respet to 
these rules, treat this lab
as the same as working in another CSE lab space in the evening.  Collaboration 
is not allowed.
