Python CGI files for a simple Image Gallery

Contains a simple `startserver.py` script that allows for local development so we don't directly push to a live server. (Only hosts cgi scripts, no CSS)

Written in Python 2.x due to assignment requirements. (sigh)
CSELabs server require cgi files to have the *.cgi extension hence why .py files are renamed as such.

- Note to self: Mixing tabs and spaces when sublime opens a python file as .cgi is very very bad, end up with a ton of bad unindentation errors.
