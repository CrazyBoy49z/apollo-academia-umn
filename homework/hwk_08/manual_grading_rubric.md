# Efficiently computing the conjunction of a list of boolean values in OCaml

+ ?? / (-10) Deduction if the function continues to traverse after encountering ``false``.


# Implementing Streams in OCaml

+ ?? / (-10) Deduction if ``squares_again`` works mainly by using something other than the ``map`` function that the students were asked to use.

+ ?? / (-10) Deduction if declarations of ``rough_guess`` and ``precise_calculation`` do not appear as given in homework description.

+ ?? / (-10) Deduction if ``sqrt_threshold`` works mainly by using something other than ``sqrt_approximations``.

+ ?? / 5 explanation of why ``sqrt_threshold``, at first glance, seems to return more accurate answers than the value of epsilon might suggest
