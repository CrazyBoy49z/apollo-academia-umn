# Git Cheat Sheet

## List of Git commands

Here are a list of *Git* commands that are most frequently used:
(in the order of most often used to least)

1. add
> Adds a file to the Git database so that Git can track the file for any updates and modifications, upon the execution of this command, the file is monitored every commit. This command is used eveytime we have a new file we want Git to track.
2. push
> Command *git push* will push whatever changes made in our local Git repository to the repository on the server. This command is used after commiting changes made to the code. It is used very frequently as it the remote repository is most updated.  
3. commit
> *git commit* will create a snapshot of the current files we have and record it into the repository. This should be used with the '-a' argument (short for 'add') to save keystrokes as it is the same as executing *git add* then *git commit*. A '-m' argument is usually encouraged as it allows for short one line messages to be recorded which assists in file revisions.
4. pull
5. status
6. clone
7. remote
8. config
