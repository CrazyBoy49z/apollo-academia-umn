# Lab 12 - Exam 2 Questions and Hwk 8 Review

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Fall 2014*

In this lab we will discuss solutions to Hwk 8 questions.  You will
also have a chance to ask questions about other material in
preparation for Exam 2 which follows on Wednesday Nov 19.

If you email your questions to csci2041@cs.umn.edu before lab
and we will include them in the initial discussions during the lab.

While attendance at most labs is required, this is not the case for
this question-and-answer style of lab.

There is nothing to turn in for this lab.
