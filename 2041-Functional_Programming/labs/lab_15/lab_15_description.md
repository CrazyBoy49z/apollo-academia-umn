# Lab 15 - Final chance for regrading homeworks and labs, also Hwk 10 questions

December 9, 2014

*CSci 2041: Advanced Programming Principles, Fall 2014*

In this lab you will have one last chance to discuss possible
regrading that needs to be done on your labs and homeworks 1 - 7.  

After 6:00pm December 9, no new requests for regrading labs or homeworks 1 -
7 will be accepted.

To verify your scores,
+ look in Moodle for scores for all labs and homeworks 1 - 5
+ look in Moodle for the automated grading portions of homeworks 6 and 7
+ look in the assessment files in your GitHub repository for the scores on the manual grading parts of homework 6 and 7.

If there is an error, please let us know by emailing the ``csci2041@cs.umn.edu`` alias.

Requests for regrades or questions about scores that are received after
6:00pm on December 9 will be handled only after the homework 8, 9, and 10
have been graded if there is still time in the semester to consider them.

By not attending lab, you are making the statement that your scores for labs
and homeworks 1 - 7 are correct.

You can also ask questions about homework 10 in this lab.

If you email your questions to csci2041@cs.umn.edu before lab
then we will include them in the initial discussions during the lab.

While attendance at some labs is required, this is not the case for
this question-and-answer style of lab.

There is nothing to turn in for this lab.

Even if you are in lab when working on a homework assignment the same
rules regarding not working toghether still apply.  With respect to
these rules, treat this lab as the same as working in another CSE lab
space in the evening.  Collaboration is not allowed.
