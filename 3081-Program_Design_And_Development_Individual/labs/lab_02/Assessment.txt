I love counting words and numbers - I always see something interesting. 
Some words pique my interest, others are less exciting.

/* We also consider numbers! */
Counting numbers is fun too - 1 2 3 4 5 6
Some are short and some, like 31557600000, are longer.  This is
roughly the number of seconds in 1000 years.

We also like floating point numbers: 3.14159 is a favorite.  But others
like 2.71828 or 0.57722 are also important. 5.89034811003 is an arbitrary float.

The notion of keywords is interesting since they also match are
regular expression for works.  So "Boot" should be matched as a
keyword.  We also want to match "Booty" as a word, since we look for
the longest match.

// A single line comment though not in ANSI-C is helpful for this assignment. 1 2.1 Boot BootPaul 
Boot

Boot boot Boot
 
// Single line comments may not start from the beginning of the line, but they do for this assignment and so as block comments.

/* We also like to hide things in comments so that they don't get
counted.  The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.5 and keywords Boot here should not be
counted in our final tally. */
