<h2>Lab 02 - Regular Expressions in C</h2>

<p>In lecture on Thursday we discussed regular expressions and how
  they can be used to specify the lexical syntax of a language.  That
  is, they define what constitutes a variable name, an integer
  literal, a floating point literal, a comment, etc. </p>

<p>In this lab you will have an opportunity to experiment with a C
  library for using regular expressions to match for patterns in
  strings.
</p>

<p>Although you will likely be working in pairs in the lab, you will
  need to turn this work in using your individual repositories.  But
  it is fine of you and your partner for today's lab turn in the same
  joint work - please make sure that both of your names appear in a
  comment at the beginning of the code and that the code is turned
  into <b>both</b> of your individual repositories as specified
  below.</p>

<p>The web has many resources for learning about regular expressions.
  One reasonable description can be found 
  <a href="http://www.proftpd.org/docs/howto/Regex.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Get the sample code</h3>
<p>For this lab you will need the following 5 files:
<ul>
<li> <code>RegexTest.cpp</code> - this program lets you
  experiment with the regular expression library by writing regular
  expression strings and checking if the match against a text
  sample.</li>

<li><code>WordCount.cpp</code> - this program counts
  the number of words and integer constants in a text file, avoid
  those inside of C-style block comments.</li>

<li><code>Sample.txt</code> - a sample input file
  containing some words, numbers and comments.</li>

<li><code>Assessment.txt</code> - the input file
  that we will use to assess your extended <code>WordCount.cpp</code>
  program.</li> 

<li><code>Solution.txt</code> - the output of your program should
  exactly match this file.
</ul>

<p>Retrieve the sample programs and associated files listed above.  These files are located in the
public class repository.  Lab 01 showed you how to check out the contents
of that repository.  Now go back to your
class repository directory and use Git to bring those
files into your workspace.  Review with your partner or the lab 1
instructions to figure out what this command is.</p>

<p>Put these five files in a directory called "lab_02" in the "labs"
directory in your <b>individual repository</b> work space.</p>

<p>You will want all of these files to be in your repository
  (and not just existing in your workspace directory as they are
  now). Thus it is always a good idea to <code>add</code> as soon as
  it is created.</p>

<p>What is the Git command for adding new files so that
  Git will track those files?  Figure this out and enter the
  appropriate command for doing this.</p>

<p> You can commit it later, but by doing the add now, Git knows
  that you want it in your repository.  This way you won't forget to
  add it later when you do a commit.</p>

<p>The assignment for this lab is to extend WordCount.cpp and to be
  sure to add your version of this file to the "labs/lab_02" directory
  in your individual Git repository.</p>

<h3>Experiment with RegexTest.cpp</h3>
<p>Compile this program but try writing a few interesting regular
expressions to try to match them against the text.  Remember that we
want the regular expression to match only at the beginning of the
text, so that "^" character is required.</p>


Here are some suggestions:
<ul>
<li><p>First compile and run the program as it is now.  Is the output
    what you expect?  Add a few spaces to the first string argument
    of <code>match</code> and see how it changes the
    behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>Change the first argument to "1234 567" and write a regular
  expression to match integer constants in the second argument.</p>

  <p>You can find just such a regular expression string in the
  WordCount.cpp program.</p>

  <p>When you run the program, does it match correctly?</p>
</li>

<li><p>Can you write a regular expression for matching floating point
    constants?</p> 

    <p>Keep it simple and just try to match a sequence of digits
    followed by a period followed by a sequence of digits.</p>

    <p>Note that the period is a special operator (which we don't need
    to use here).  But you will need to "escape it" by making sure
    that in the string passed to the function there is a backslash
    before the period.   But be careful!  We want that backslash in
    the string - and a backslash is also an escape character in C
    strings.  Thus you may need 2 backslashes in the literal string
    representation in the program.   Make sure you understand why this
    is. </p>
</li>

<li>Write a regular expression that matches a left parenthesis. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Counting floating point number constants</h3>
<p>The first modification to make the WordCount.cpp program is to make it
include floating point numbers in the count of integers.   So, if we
add "1.23" somewhere in the Sample.txt file, it will report 1 more
number.  Originally there were 4 numbers, now it will return 5.</p>

<p>If you compile and run WordCount on the Assessment.txt file now it
  shows that is found 105 words and 16 numbers.  In your final version,
  it should show 12 numbers.  Right now the string "3.1415" is being
  counted as two integers (the same holds for the string "2.71828" and 
  the string "0.57722").
  When these are properly counted as 1 number, your solution will
  report 12 numbers being found.</p>

<p>The point here is that when a floating point constant is found, the
  value in "numNumericConsts" is increased by one.  We are NOT creating
  another counter just for floating point numbers - we are re-using the 
  same counter as we use to count integer numbers.</p>

<p>A key thing to consider here is that when a floating point constant
  is seen in the text, both the floating point regular expression and
  the integer regular expression will both match.  We want to only
  take the longest match.   That is why we keep track of the length of
  the longest match in "maxNumMatchedChars".</p>

<h3>Counting keywords</h3>

<p>In building a scanner for our functional programming language, we will
  have some reserved keywords.  We would like to investigate how we
  might do that.  Here, we will count the number of times that the
  word "Boot" appears in the input text.</p>

<p>To do this, we will create a regular expression that matches only
  "Boot" at the beginning of the text.  We need a new value in the
  enumerated type "matchType", perhaps "BootMatch".  We also need a new
  counter, perhaps "numBoots".</p>

<p>We also need another bit of code the call "matchRegex" and possibly
  update the Boot counter and set matchType appropriately.  This code
  will be much like what is already there.</p>

<p>However, you should think carefully about where to put this new
  code snippet.  Notice that the regular expression for a word will
  also match the letters "Boot".  We don't want to have to write a
  regular expression for words that somehow takes all words except
  "Boot".  Instead we want to write our code so that the Boot regular
  expression <b>takes precedence</b> over the word regular
  expression.  That is, when the text is "Boot123", we want to match
  the first three letters as a Boot, not as a word.  But if the text is
  "BootBit123" then we want to match the first 7 letters as a word.</p>

<p>This is what happens in many programming languages.  The string
  "while" might be a keyword in the language, but the string
  "whileLoopCounter" might be a variable name.</p>

<p>So, we want to take the longest match possible.  But if two regular
  expressions match and match the same number of characters, then we
  want to take the one with the higher precedence.  Here, the Boot
  regular expression is said to have higher precedence than the word
  regular expression.</p>

<p>Don't forget to print out the number of "Boot"s that your program
  finds - just add another print statement after the existing two print statements.</p>

<p>Test out your code by adding "Boot123" and "BootyBooty123" to the sample
  input file (Sample.txt).  You should get 1 Boot and one more word than you
  calculated before.  (You'll also get 2 additional numbers.)</p>

<p>Note that case matters.  "Boot" is a Boot keyword but "boot" is just a
  word.  We only count "Boot"s that begin with a capital "B".</p>

<h3>Validating your outcome</h3>
<p>Run your final program against the <code>Assessment.txt</code> files,
redirecting the output to <code>MyOutput.txt</code>.</p>

<pre>
   ./a.out Assessment.txt > MyOutput.txt
   diff MyOutput.txt Solution.txt 
</pre>

<p>If <code>diff</code> shows no differences between the files then
you've successfully completed the programming.</p>

<p>Now be sure to commit your solution to your individual repository.</p>

<h3>Due Date</h3>
<p>
This work is due on Thursday, Sept 18th at 11:59pm.
</p>

<h3>Turning in your work</h3>

<p>Make sure that your name, and the name of your (temporary) lab
  partner if you worked together, is added to the top of the file.
  You work will be graded separately however, so both of you need to
  get the appropriate files into <b>both</b> of your individual
  repositories.</p> 

<p>Critically, the file should be named <code>WordCount.cpp</code> and
  stored in the directory <code>labs/lab_02</code> of your individual
  Git repository.</p>
